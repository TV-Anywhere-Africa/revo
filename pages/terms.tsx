          mCini provides a subscription streaming service that allows our users
          to access entertainment content in the form of movies, series, skits,
          telenovelas, etc. These terms and conditions govern the use of the
          service. As used in these terms and conditions &ldquo;our
          service&rdquo;, &ldquomCini service&rdquo; or &ldquothe service&rdquo;
          refers to all the services that mCini provides which enables you to
          discover and access its content, features and functionalities, user
          interfaces, and software.
        </p>
        <b>1. Membership / Account:</b>
        <p className="leading-[31px]">
          1.1 To use certain features of the mCini service, you must register
          for an account. You may be required to sign up with your mobile number
          via an OTP process to create a user account. You are solely
          responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and
          you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under
          your account.
        </p>

        <p className="leading-[31px]">
          1.2 The information you provide to mCini, whether at
          registration/signup or at any other time, will be true, accurate,
          current, and complete. You should also ensure that this information is
          always kept accurate and up-to-date. If you have reason to believe
          that your account is no longer secure (e.g., in the event of a loss,
          theft, or unauthorized disclosure or use of your account ID), then you
          should immediately notify mCini at support@mcini.tv. You may be liable
          for the losses incurred by mCini or others due to any unauthorized use
          of your account.

        <b>2. Billing and Cancellation</b>
        <p className="leading-[31px]">
          <b>2.1 Billing</b>
          <br />
          You will be charged a fee to be able to access the mCini service.
          Payment for the mCini subscription fee can be made via mobile money
          wallet. The user is required to approve a one-time auto-debit mandate
          which allows recurrent billing on your mobile money wallet to
          auto-renew your subscription to the service. The billing amount will
          depend on your subscription package (daily/weekly). The length of your
          subscription cycle will depend on the subscription package you choose
          during signup to the mCini service i.e. daily or weekly. mCini
          reserves the right to suspend a user&apos;s access to the service when
          a payment fails due to insufficient funds or any other reason that may
          cause subscription payments not to be settled successfully.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-[31px]">
          <b>2.2 Cancellation</b>
          <br />
          You can cancel your mCini subscription at any time. To cancel your
          subscription, you can visit &lsquo;my account&rsquo; and select
          &lsquo;cancel subscription&rsquo; to cancel or dial *380*5# to revoke
          the auto-debit mandate to discontinue the auto-renewal of your
          subscription. A user may not receive a refund from mCini after such
          cancellation. After canceling your subscription, you may continue to
          have access to the mCini service through to the end of the paid
          subscription billing period.

          fees. Any change to your subscription plan and fee will take effect no
          earlier than thirty (30) days after you have been notified of such
